# My-Company-Project
The company project for CIS130.
I worked on this project with two other individuals. My main assignment was to style the page with CSS only as well as correct any grammatical errors. 
James worked on the index page while Marcus worked on the about page.
Although the project's html had a light, humerous tone, I did my best to style the page to make it look professional. 
Initially, a couple of images were provided along with the index.html page, but they did not fit the vision I had for the project so some of them were not used.
